    <h3>What does this analysis show?</h3>
    <p class="my-4">
      The network is scanned for sets of validating nodes that intersect every
      quorum (network blocking sets). It reports the minimum sizes as a risk
      analysis, and lists all the sets. The nodes can be grouped by
      organization, ISP and country
    </p>
    <h3>What does it mean?</h3>
    <p class="my-4">
      When all the nodes of a network blocking set fail, the network could halt.
      If the analysis indicates the minimum size is 3, then 3 specific nodes
      have to fail before this will happen. The same goes for the other
      groupings (organization, isp, country)
    </p>
    <h3>Limitations of the analysis</h3>
    <p class="my-4">
      Stellarobserver indicates a node as 'not validating' if it was not validating
      in the latest crawl, a specific time window. However a node could be very
      slow or catching up. If other (fast) nodes of a network blocking set are
      down, the slow node could catch up and the network would continue to
      validate. Hence this graph is a risk analysis. For ISP and country
      information of nodes we rely on the
      <a href="https://ipstack.com/">IPstack api</a>. This data is not
      guaranteed to be correct.
